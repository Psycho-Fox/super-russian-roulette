Cards: Cards for Super One in the Chamber
GameTable: Where the players sit at, entity that spawns in via the map, this will mean you have to have a supported map for the gamemode, which can be a bitch for some players, especially onces who want to play on some stupid ass map like mario kart or something. But I don't want to do some shabby thing where I make the host place the fucking table down with a menu because that's awful who the hell would want to do that it'd be like that jumpgame addon from Gmod where you have to place the fucking game down.
Revolver: This is the main gun that players pass around to blow their brains out with, this is separate from Weapons because of how it's designed, since it's a core part of the gamemode and not just a weapon you pull out to kill players with, however in gamemodes where you DO kill players, or when you place down a kill player card it might be a bit of a bitch.
Skins: These will be weapon skins the player purchases in the shop with currency from the current server they're playing on, these are purely cosmetic skins for the guns however it's cool and hip to gloat about your win streak and purchase the red fire gun for 999 points and look like a badass. 
Weapons: Every player gets a pocket revolver they can whip out to kill other players when they're allowed to, every player gets a mug or bottle of beer to throw as well. TODO: Model mug, Model Revolver.
