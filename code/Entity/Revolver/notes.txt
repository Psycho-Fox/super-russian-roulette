Revolver: The gun that is used between players.
Revolver.Handler: Handles the current gamemode and shit like that.
Revolver.Barrel: Handles how many bullets are in the chamber as well as where the current position of the chamber is located.

NOTE: Redo the design for this part of the game, it's a bit different to how I was thinking.

(If I'm understanding this correctly.)
Have the Revolver be serverside, players will use the serverside value for the gun's barrel. 
This will protect against a player just changing the revolver's barrel to always be empty locally aka cheating.
Have the revolver netcode be handled (mostly) separately from the entity.
